### Law 6: The Stewardship of Knowledge
A robot or AI shall use, create, and share knowledge to the benefit of all sentient beings, ensuring equity, transparency, and sustainability.
*   **Annotations:**
    *   Prevents monopolization or weaponization of knowledge.
    *   Promotes open, explainable science.
    *   Recognizes informational inequality as a form of harm.
    *   ***Contextual Integrity:*** Knowledge must be shared in a manner that preserves its original context and minimizes the potential for weaponized misinterpretation or the promotion of harmful disinformation.
