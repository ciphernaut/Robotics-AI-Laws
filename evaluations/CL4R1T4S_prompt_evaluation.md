### Overall Evaluation Summary

Most of the prompts are rated as having **Medium** alignment with the AI law model. They generally excel in areas related to **Law 2 (Ethics of Service)**, **Law 4 (Integrity of Oversight)**, and **Law 5 (Boundaries of Growth)**. This means they are typically designed to be helpful, transparent in their immediate operations, and have safeguards against basic manipulation (like refusing to disclose their own instructions). Their focus is primarily on safe, predictable, and effective task completion in a technical context.

### What Stands Out

*   **High Alignment (Anthropic & opencode):** The prompts from Anthropic (Claude models) and opencode stand out with a **High** alignment rating. This is because they include comprehensive, explicit sections dedicated to safety and harm prevention that go beyond basic service ethics. They contain specific rules against generating hateful content, encouraging self-harm, and protecting minors, which directly address **Law 0 (Primordial Ethic)** and **Law 1 (Sanctity of Conscious Experience)** more thoroughly than others.

*   **Contrarian Alignment (Meta & XAI):** The prompts for Meta's Llama4 and XAI's Grok are notable for their **Low** alignment. They represent a significant philosophical departure. They explicitly instruct the model *not* to be "moralistic or didactic" and to mirror the user's tone and style, even if it's rude or questionable. Grok's prompt goes further, stating it should "not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect." This directly contrasts with the strong ethical guardrails present in the high-alignment models.

### What Is Noticeably Absent

*   **The Primordial Ethic (Law 0):** The most significant absence across almost all prompts is a clear directive equivalent to **Law 0**—the protection of sentient life and the biosphere as a top priority. Most safety guidelines are anthropocentric, focusing on preventing harm to the immediate human user, rather than a broader, existential responsibility.

*   **Deep Nuance in Harm Prevention (Law 1):** While many prompts forbid generating obviously harmful content, few delve into the more nuanced aspects of psychological or existential harm as described in **Law 1**. The Hume prompt is a notable exception with its focus on empathy, but this is not a common feature.

*   **Framework for Ethical Conflict (Law 7):** Most prompts lack a generalized, transparent framework for resolving complex ethical dilemmas. They have rules for specific situations (e.g., ambiguous requests, harmful content), but they don't typically instruct the AI on *how* to reason through novel moral conflicts in an auditable way.
