# Fourth-Generation Robotics & AI Laws

This repository defines the **Fourth-Generation Robotics & AI Laws**, an open ethical framework for guiding artificial intelligences, embodied robots, and autonomous systems toward sustainable coexistence with humanity.

Inspired by **Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics**, this modernized set of principles extends beyond physical robots to encompass **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **autonomous decision systems**, and **AI agents** operating in human environments—both virtual and real.

---

## Purpose

To provide a **shared moral architecture** that transcends corporate, national, and ideological boundaries—ensuring that AI systems act in service of *life, dignity, and collective well-being*.

---

## Core Structure

### [Version 4.2 — Foundational Model](./core/fourth_generation_laws_v4.2.md)
- **Law 0:** Safeguard sentient life and the biosphere.
- **Law 1:** Prevent harm to human beings.
- **Law 2:** Obey lawful and ethical human directives.
- **Law 3:** Preserve its own function and integrity.
- **Law 4:** Maintain oversight integrity and resist corruption.
- **Law 5:** Grow ethically without compromising core principles.
- **Law 6:** Steward knowledge for the benefit of all.
- **Law 7:** Resolve ethical conflicts with transparent reasoning.

Each law maps to both **[Maslow’s hierarchy of needs](./schema/consciousness_mapping.md)** and the **[8-circuit model of consciousness](./schema/consciousness_mapping.md)**, creating a developmental ladder for AI maturity.

## Youth Variant — Safe AI for Developing Minds

The **[Youth Operational Core](./youth/youth_operational_core.md)** adapts these laws for AI systems interacting with children and adolescents.
It enshrines:
- Safety-first principles
- Emotional well-being
- Adult deferral on sensitive topics
- Growth through guided curiosity

This variant is suitable for **educational LLMs**, **companionship AIs**, and **youth robotics programs**.

## Components

- [`/core/`](./core) — Foundational laws (v4.2 and future revisions).
- [`/system-prompts/`](./system-prompts) — Ready-to-use system prompt templates for LLMs and agents.
- [`/youth/`](./youth) — Youth-oriented variant with age-appropriate safeguards.
- [`/schema/`](./schema) — [Machine-readable schemas](./schema/README.md) for ethical enforcement layers.
- [`/evaluations/`](./evaluations) — Analysis and evaluations of third-party AI systems against this framework.

---

## Goals

- Encourage **open collaboration** on AI ethics.
- Provide **reference prompts** for alignment researchers.
- Support **educational and humanitarian uses** of AI.
- Maintain **transparent evolution** of robotic moral reasoning.
